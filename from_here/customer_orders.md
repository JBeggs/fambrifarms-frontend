### Restaurant Orders (Plain Language)

1) Make a wishlist
- Browse products and add what you want with quantities
- You can change quantities or remove items anytime

2) Place the order (Mondays/Thursdays)
- On those days, press “Place Order” from your wishlist
- The system will decide supplier vs. in-house for each item

3) What happens next
- Staff confirm your order and send purchase orders to suppliers
- If an item is made in-house, production is scheduled
- You get updates as the order moves from pending → delivered

Example
- You add: 10kg carrots, 5 heads lettuce
- Carrots: cheapest supplier is A → PO sent to Supplier A
- Lettuce: in-house available → reserved from our stock
- You see both items and the final total in your order
