### One-Page Overview (Simple)

What this system does
- Lets restaurants order fresh produce from Fambri Farms
- Helps Fambri staff manage stock, production, and suppliers
- Creates purchase orders to suppliers and invoices to customers

How ordering works
- Restaurants add items to a wishlist, then place an order on Tuesdays/Fridays
- The system decides for each item: buy from a supplier or make it in-house
- Staff see supplier purchase orders to send and receive deliveries

Who uses it
- Restaurant users: build wishlists, place orders, view invoices
- Fambri staff: confirm orders, manage stock, run production, receive supplier deliveries
- Managers/CEOs: see dashboards, approve big decisions

What weâ€™re building next
- Simple screens for purchase orders and receiving
- A clean dashboard with key numbers (orders, stock alerts)
- Basic reports (orders this week, open purchase orders, low stock)

Where to login
- New app: login at `/login`, register at `/register`
- After login, restaurants go to their dashboard; staff go to the admin dashboard
